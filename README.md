## 💡 Why Master Docker for CI/CD?

Docker is a cornerstone of modern DevOps and CI/CD, and here’s why:
1. **Portability**: Run applications consistently across environments.
2. **Efficiency**: Lightweight containers reduce resource usage compared to VMs.
3. **Scalability**: Easily scale applications with Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.
4. **Industry Standard**: Widely used in 6 LPA+ DevOps and SWE roles.
5. **Ecosystem**: Integrates seamlessly with CI/CD tools, cloud platforms, and orchestrators.

This repo is my roadmap to mastering Docker for technical interviews and DevOps careers—let’s containerize like pros together!
